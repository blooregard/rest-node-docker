# rest-node-docker

This is a sample microservice that uses node.js and MongoDB to expose a RESTful services.

This was heavily inspired by the work of dwmkerr (http://www.dwmkerr.com/learn-docker-by-building-a-microservice/)

# Pre-requisites

You must have Docker installed for this to work.

# Execution

```bash
cd ./rest-node-docker
docker-compose build
docker-compose up

#Shutdown in another terminal
docker-compose down
```
